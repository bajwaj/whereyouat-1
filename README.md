# Where You At

## Inspiration

My sister and I wanted to practice safe social distancing with COVID-19 SIP restrictions but kept running into crowds! I took the opportunity to submit an idea for an web application that can quickly give you information regarding foot traffic and COVID-19 cases before you head out the door. I found a great group of engineers and medical professionals who were interested in the same type of web application. Below is the mission and vision statement we came up with together:

Mission Statement: “To empower individuals and communities to create a safe and connected world.” Vision Statement: “To provide planning data in one touch.”

## What it does

We have developed a local web application that uses the Google Place API and uploaded COVID-19 information (cases per county and cases per dat) to the console. Next steps include:

Determine accessible parameters from the API. For example, “Can we group by the county for the first 5 results returned”.

County and cases information. For example, “________ county has _______ cases as of mm/dd/yyyy.”

Predictive Analysis- Display results from our survey. For example, “Did you know from our survey of over 100 people _____ percent of people like to ________ in the morning/afternoon/evening?”

## How we built it

As mentioned we used Google Places API as well as a JSON file retrieved from the San Francisco Chronicles.

Our survey received over 100 responses! We retrieved the survey data as a CSV file and further analyzed the data using Python/Matplotlib to create graphs and charts.

For data collection/analysis we used the F.A.I.R data principles:

F: Findability (Where are our data?)

A: Accessibility (How can I get the data?)

I: Interoperability (How can I connect or integrate the data?)

R: Reliability (Can our data be easily shared and used again?)

## Challenges we ran into

Current challenges we are running into is making the information box dynamic to include information regarding county and cases as well as our survey analysis. If anyone is interested and wants to help with out challenges please reach out!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We have a great start to a very useful project! Our mission and vision is strong and we know exactly what technical steps we need to make in order to make our product user friendly.

## What we learned

Great products aren't made overnight! Specifically, working with Google HeatMaps/Places API to make it dynamic has been a challenge.

## What's next for "Where You At"

Please take a look at our video! We are looking for front/backend engineers, data scientists and anyone enthusiastic to join our cause. Together we can make something great to help us all stay connected in this new norm.
